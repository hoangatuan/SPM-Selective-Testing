This is a tool to help you run only the tests that have changed since the last successful test run, instead of re-run all the tests every time.

## Why

As the project grows, more and more tests are added. It makes **the time to run all the tests increase dramatically**.   
As your team grows, more and more times your team and your CI need to run the tests.   
Especially on CI, we normally clean and re-run all the tests, **regardless of the changes**.   
With `spm-test-selective`, we can **run only the tests that have changed since the last successful test run**, reducing the time to run the tests significantly. ðŸš€

## Installation

This project is still in the development phase, and not ready for production.

## Usage

```bash
    // Init a default configuration for your project
    spm-test-selective init

    // Perform selective testing
    spm-test-selective $PROJECT-PATH $TEST-PLAN-PATH
```

## How it works

<img src=Resources/flow.png/>

1. Find all SPM modules in the project
2. Generate hashes for all SPM modules
3. For each module, compare its current hash with its cache hash.
4. If any module's hash is different from its cache hash, add that module to the test plan. Otherwise, disable that module in the test plan.
5. Run tests with the test plan.
6. If run tests successfully, update the cache.
